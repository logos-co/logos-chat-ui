# Role: doc-test display entry (the `#group` flake app); wraps run-group.sh then holds the window open.
# Run the real three-party group conversation, then hold the newest member's
# window open showing the result — the entry point for the `#group` flake app the
# doc-test drives.
#
# A group forms slowly (three delivery nodes finding each other, then two
# membership commits over the network), while the doc-test caps its capture step
# at 120s. So this splits the work: the slow group flow runs first, on its own
# inspector ports, and all three instances are *kept alive* (chats are ephemeral
# — the module persists nothing, so there is no history to reload a fresh window
# from). Only once the flow is done does SHOW_PORT open, as a TCP proxy onto
# Carol's live inspector. The doc-test attaches to that finished window and
# screenshots it well within its budget — the flow happens during the unbounded
# `launch_timeout` port-wait, before SHOW_PORT ever opens.
#
# Usage:
#   run-group-show.sh [base-dir]
# Env:
#   APP_BIN       run-logos-standalone-ui path (baked in by the flake app)
#   SHOW_PORT     capture port the doc-test attaches to (default 3768)
