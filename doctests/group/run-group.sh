# Role: headless three-party group-chat test driver (CI); see run-group-show.sh for the doc-test display variant.
# Regenerate the three-instance group-chat screenshots for the docs.
#
# Launches three logos-chat-ui instances offscreen — each with its own data dir,
# delivery-node port, and QML inspector port — drives a real group conversation
# between them via the logos-qt-mcp inspector protocol (run-group.mjs): Alice
# creates the group, invites Bob and Carol, and once the roster converges sends a
# message that fans out to both. Writes the screenshots to OUT_DIR and exits
# non-zero if the flow does not complete, so this doubles as an end-to-end
# integration check. The three instances coexist because each picks a random
# QtRO socket name and we give each a distinct data dir / delivery port /
# inspector port.
#
# Usage:
#   doctests/group/run-group.sh [out-dir]
# Env:
#   FLAKE        flake ref to build the app from (default ".")
#   APP_BIN      run-logos-standalone-ui path; if unset, built from FLAKE
#   OUT_DIR      screenshot dir (default arg1, else docs/images/group)
#   WORK_DIR     per-instance data/log dir; if unset, a fresh mktemp is used
#   KEEP_WORK_DIR  if set, WORK_DIR is left in place on exit (e.g. to keep the
#                  app logs); processes are still torn down
#   KEEP_INSTANCES if set, a *successful* run leaves the three instances running
#                  (and their WORK_DIR in place) — the caller owns their
#                  teardown; a failed run still tears everything down
